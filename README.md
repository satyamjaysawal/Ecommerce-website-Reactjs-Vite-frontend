# E-Commerce Project - React + Vite + FastAPI + Neon DB (SQL) + Swagger UI + 

Welcome to the E-Commerce Project repository! This project is designed to be a fully functional e-commerce platform with role-based authentication and a variety of features for customers, vendors, and admins.

## Deployment

The frontend of the project has been deployed and is accessible through the following URL:
[**E-Commerce Website**](https://ecommerce-website-reactjs-vite-frontend.onrender.com)

## Overview

This E-Commerce platform allows users to browse, shop, and manage orders. Vendors can list their products, manage inventory, and handle orders. Admins can manage users, view analytics, and oversee all operations on the platform.

### Key Features:
- User authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Role-based access control (Customer, Vendor, Admin)
- Product listing, shopping cart, and order processing
- Admin dashboard with sales analytics and revenue reports
- Vendor product management and order fulfillment

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React.js
  - TailwindCSS
  - Axios (for API communication)
  - Lucide React (for icons)

- **Backend**:
  - FastAPI (Python)
  - SQLAlchemy (ORM for database interaction)
  - PostgreSQL (database)
  - JWT (for secure authentication)
  - Razorpay (payment gateway)

- **Other**:
  - Docker (for containerization)
  - Python's `pytz` (for timezone management)
  - Git & GitHub (for version control)

## Features

### 1. **User Management**
   - **Sign Up / Login / Logout**: Customers and vendors can sign up, log in, and log out.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

### Backend Setup (FastAPI)
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
   cd your-repository-directory
   ```

2. Create a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the environment variables:
   - **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection URL
   - **SECRET_KEY**: A secure key for JWT token encoding
   - **RAZORPAY_API_KEY**: API key for Razorpay

   Example `.env` file:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/ecommerce_db
  # DATABASE_URL=postgresql://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx?sslmode=require
  # FRONTEND_URL=https://ecommerce-website-reactjs-vite-frontend.onrender.com
  FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
  PORT=8080
   RAZORPAY_API_KEY=your_razorpay_api_key
   ```

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend Setup (React)
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Database Setup
Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database running. You can use Docker to set up the database easily:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the PostgreSQL container.

### Docker Setup
You can use Docker to run both the frontend and backend services in containers. The project contains a `docker-compose.yml` file to handle both services.

To run the project using Docker:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Deployment
